# WordPress-Admin-Login-2FA-with-Email-Verification
This WordPress plugin adds an extra layer of security to admin logins by implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) via email. Users will receive a one-time code in their email to complete the login process, ensuring enhanced protection against unauthorized access.
